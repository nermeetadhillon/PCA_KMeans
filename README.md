# PCA_KMeans

PCA
The task is to implement implement principal compomnent analysis (PCA) using numpy, and conduct some experiments that are similar to the "EigenFace" study. 

KMEANS
The task is to implement K-means clustering. Here we specifically use the PCA module provided by the sklearn package for pre-clustering analysis and post-clustering visualization

# Data
The sign language image data will be used for both the PCA and KMeans analysis. For the PCA, we will select the image data of one class and extract its principal components. We then visualize the data by reducing the dimension to the first 2 dominant PCs.
